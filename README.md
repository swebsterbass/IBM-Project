## Witness
###   Spencer Webster-Bass

In this project we will be creating an app that will send bystanders to witness interactions between police and civilians. This app will not encourage people to place themselves in danger, but will commend those who are comfortable leveraging their privilege to help people of marginalized groups.

## Motivation
Will Smith said during an interview with Stephen Colbert on the 'Late Show' that "Racism is not getting worse, it's getting filmed."
Over the years as technology and it's accessibility improved there has been an increase of police brutality being recorded on video. With the quality of these videos being vastly better than years prior, these videos seem to help bring awareness and justice. We want this app to make that process convenient and accessible.

## Tools
